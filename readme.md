If you dont know how to compile java, just look it up or use the python version, they both do the same thing

## Usage:

### Python
```console
python batuino.py test.bat
```

### Java:
```console
java batuino.jar
// will ask for file name
```

Both outputs `batuino_output.ino`, you can change the name within the code or after running

open the arduino sketch in the Arduino IDE and upload to a HID compatible board such as the Arduino Pro Micro.
